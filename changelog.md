# Changelog

The changelog will record what content was **changed** (e.g. changed an existing paragraph to a better-explained version, re-ran the notebook using an updated version of the package), **added** (e.g. new content) **fixed** (e.g. grammar mistakes, typos, redundant spaces)

## [2017-06-30]

This is the first time that the changelog file is added, thus every existing notebook will fall under the added category. Will try to group the log by month (one or two) in the future. Note that this repo will be geared towards Python3. Hence, even though the repo contains some R-related contents, they are not that well maintained and will most likely be translated to Python3. As always, any feedbacks are welcomed.
